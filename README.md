The EmotiVis system aims to satisfy the need for interactive data visualization content-creators to be able to conveniently gather, manage, and access relevant user data about their published content in a currently unavailable way. Through our web platform, content creators can log into their account, collect and manage emotional response data using the Affectiva Javascript library, and use our informative visualization to better understand their users.
